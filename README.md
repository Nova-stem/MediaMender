# MediaMender

**MediaMender** is a desktop tool for processing, organizing, and tagging Movies, TV Shows, and Audiobooks. It remuxes media, cleans and converts subtitles, adds metadata, and supports Whisper-based transcription — all from a drag-and-drop GUI.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎬 Auto-detects and separates Movies, TV Shows, and Audiobooks
- 📚 Metadata lookup via TMDb (video) and OpenLibrary (audio)
- 🧠 Subtitle generation with Whisper — supports GPU acceleration
- 💬 Subtitle correction, conversion, and tagging
- 📦 MKV remuxing with embedded tracks and forced flags
- 🔄 Dry-run mode for safe preview of actions
- 🧹 Automatically trashes processed and intermediate files

---

## 🖥 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- FFmpeg (must be available on system PATH or installed by app)
- MKVToolNix (`mkvmerge`)
- Whisper model files (downloaded on first use)
- NVIDIA GPU (optional, for acceleration)

---

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nova-stem/MediaMender.git
cd MediaMender
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

The GUI allows drag-and-drop media files, setting preferences, and running background processing with progress tracking.

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Preferences are stored in a `config/` folder (excluded for security).

First-time use will:
- Prompt for missing Whisper models and download them
- Check for FFmpeg and MKVToolNix
- Configure GPU acceleration if available

---

## 🛠 Developer Notes

- Thread-safe GUI built with PySide6
- Uses `faster-whisper` for GPU support
- Subtitle pipeline includes: detection → cleaning → tagging → muxing
- Structured for future `.exe` packaging
